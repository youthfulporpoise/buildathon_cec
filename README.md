# Personal Wiki
A simple personal wiki with rich editing and support for mathematical formulas.
The entire wiki is a single HTML file with included CSS and JavaScript
components.  Saving the wiki will create a new HTML file with the progress,
since directly managing files is not idiomatically allowed within JavaScript.
